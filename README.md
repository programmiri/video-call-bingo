### Disclaimer
Thankfully, a lot of us are in the __very__ privileged situation to be able to work from home during these trying times with Covid-19. So, complaining about long video-calls is something we Germans call *"Jammern auf hohem Niveau"*, what translate roughly to *"complaining on a very high comfort level"*.
